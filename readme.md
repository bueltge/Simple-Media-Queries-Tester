# Simple Media Queries Tester

CSS Media Queries are getting more popular and the adjustment of the size of a website for different clients or the size of the browsers are more necessary. The Media Queries are a solution, which also have its advantages and disadvantages. It was a disadvantage, when using, that I couldn't see all sizes at the same time. So why not just a small script, the iframe element. If you like to use it, [here](http://bueltge.de/test/media-query-tester.php) my current solution live.

The solution can be expanded and improved, enjoy.
